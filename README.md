# ELIZA-GPT

ELIZA-GPT is a project that integrates the concepts of the classic ELIZA chatbot with modern GPT-based AI models. This project aims to combine the simplicity of rule-based conversational agents with the versatility and depth of generative AI models.

## Features

- **Hybrid Chatbot**: Combines rule-based and generative AI techniques.
- **Modern NLP**: Leverages GPT-based models for contextual and intelligent responses.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend rules and behavior for tailored use cases.

## Technology Stack

This project is primarily built with:
- **Java** (97.5%): Core implementation of the chatbot logic and integrations.
- **Shell** (2.5%): Scripts for setup, deployment, or auxiliary tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/massi-maouche/ELIZA-GPT.git
   cd ELIZA-GPT
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven (or your preferred Java build tool):
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/eliza-gpt.jar
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot via a terminal-based interface or integrate it into a larger application using the provided APIs.

### Example

```text
User: Hello, ELIZA!
ELIZA: Hello! How can I assist you today?
```
